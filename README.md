# My Awesome Project
A revamped portfolio that introduces a little about me as well as showcases some of my favorite projects.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Vite, TailwindCSS

## Lessons Learned:

This was a fun project for me because I did a few things I never did before. 

One of the major things was using React Router for the first time and then using the isActive attribute to add styling the button of the page that it is currently on.

On the homepage, I used a typewriter effect to add a little bit of liveliness to the site that I thought was missing. 

I also did the cards differently. Up to now I only had these small containers that had a brief description and then a link to the site. This time, I gave myself space to talk a little bit more about what the project was about and what I did. I also created a subtle but interesting effect where each alternating card would be reverse of the previous card. So one side of the card would be a description and the other would be the image preview of the project and they would alternate.
