This was one of my first React projects that I created and am extremely proud of.

It's a great project that shows a little bit about me."

I thought it would be really awesome to create a website that gives the user random stoic quotes from various sources. It is a simple app but I added a little dynamic to the button that starts off by saying 'Click Here' then changes to 'One More!'."

The most difficult challenge of this game is the Ace, which can either be a 1 or 11 depending on the player/computer's total."

I'm proud of how this one turned out because when something is marked as complete, it gets moved to a different list with the string crossed out; however, the user has the option to also delete the task if it was a mistake or not what they wanted to input. That said, the one downfall of this application is that once the page refreshes, everything gets erased. It does not get stored in localstorage... yet."
